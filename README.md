# sal-predict
The Salary Prediction Model uses linear regression to estimate salaries based on factors like education, experience, job title, location, age, and gender. It preprocesses data by encoding categorical variables, trains the model, and evaluates its accuracy with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
